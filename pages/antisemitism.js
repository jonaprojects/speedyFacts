        Following the October 7th Attack and Israel&apos;s retaliation of Gaza,
        antisemitism has become extremely prevalent in Europe. Many racist and
        violent protests have took place around the world, with explicit and
        implicit calls to kill the Jews and to destroy the state of Israel.
        Violent antisemitic incidents have also risen dramatically, most notably
        in campuses in the US and in Europe.

            "The spike of antisemitic incidents across Europe has reached extraordinary
            levels in the last few days, reminiscent of some of the darkest times in
            history. European Jews today are again living in fear. We have seen a
            resurgence of antisemitic incidents and rhetoric in the European Union and
            worldwide: Molotov cocktails thrown on a synagogue in Germany, stars of
            David sprayed on residential buildings in France, a Jewish cemetery
            desecrated in Austria, Jewish stores and synagogues attacked in Spain,
            demonstrators chanting hate slogans against Jews". -European Commission, November 5th, 2023.

      people in ages 18-34 in France have never heard of the holocaust. 
      More than a quarter believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance. One in five believe anti-Semitism is a response to the everyday actions of Jews. 
    Across the seven countries in the survey, one in 10 people said they have an unfavorable attitude toward Jews.`}
